.NET Core allows us to create and run .NET apps on many platforms, but actually shipping our apps is hard, especially
if those apps aren't web apps that use one of the well-integrated publishing methods (WebDeploy, Azure, Docker, ...).

Node already allows to package up apps and then install and use them using:
```
> npm install -g something
> something
```

The upcoming .NET Core SDK 2.1.300, slated to be released with .NET Core 2.1, will offer a similar functionality:

```
> dotnet install tool -g something
> something
```

These applications are downloaded and installed from NuGet and are marked as a special package type.

So let's build one ourself. Get a preview `2.1.300` .NET Core SDK version from the links at [https://github.com/dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) to follow along. The full sample is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/dasMulli/GlobalCliToolsExample](https://github.com/dasMulli/GlobalCliToolsExample).

## Some config first

In order to use preview packages from the nightly feed and use our built nuget packages:

* Create a folder to work in, this will be the base for all commands run
* Create a folder named `nupkgs` that will hold our built NuGet packages
* Run `dotnet new nugetconfig` to generate a `nuget.config` file. Edit it to add the custom folder and the CI feed:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
 <packageSources>
    <add key="local-packages" value="./nupkgs" />
    <add key="dotnet-core" value="https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json" />
 </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

## Create the app

So we now need an application to work with. As a good sample, let's create a program that just greets the user:

```
> dotnet new console -o sayhi.tool
```

This will create a folder `sayhi.tool` and a console app and `.csproj` file inside of it. First, I don't like "Hello World!" that much, so changed the `Program.cs` file to something slightly more interesting:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hi {Environment.UserName}!");
}
```

## Mark the app as tool

In order to be packed correctly so that we can install the app as a tool, we need to change the `sayhi.tool.csproj` file a little:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
    <PackAsTool>true</PackAsTool>
    <ToolCommandName>sayhi</ToolCommandName>
    <PackageOutputPath>../nupkgs</PackageOutputPath>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

<div class="note">

Using `netcoreapp2.1` will cause the tool to break between .NET Core 2.1 preview releaes. You will need to release/publish new version for each preview / RC release because the exact preview runtime version will be hardcoded into the generated output.

You can use `netcoreapp2.0` instead during the preview / RC timeframe to create a .NET Core 2.0 tool.
</div>

While you may recognize `OutputType` and `TargetFramework` from normal csproj files, there are a few new ones here:

* `PackageOutputPath`: This tells `dotnet pack` where to put the `.nupkg` file to. This propertiy isn't new and alredy exists in released tooling. For our example, it needs to point to the path we configured in `nuget.config`.
* `PackAsTool`: This instructs the tooling to package our app correctly for being installed as a tool.
* `ToolCommandName`: This lets us choose the command line executable name for the app. It defaults to the assembly name of the application, but want to type `sayhi` instead of `sayhi.tool` in this example.

## Build and run!

In the top level folder for this sample, run:

```
> dotnet pack -c Release
â€¦ 
Successfully created package 'C:\repos\GlobalCliToolsExample\nupkgs\sayhi.tool.1.0.0.nupkg'.

> dotnet install tool -g sayhi.tool

The installation succeeded. If there are no further instructions, you can type the following command in shell directly to invoke: sayhi
```

You may see some warnings because of prerelease version numbers being used by the preview tooling - you can ignore them.

Now to be safe, open up a **new console window**. You can skip this if you already used global tools before, but if this is your first `dotnet install` call, you may still need to do so.

Our program can now be run from the command line using just:

```
> sayhi
Hi martin.ullrich!
```

## Where is it installed to?

Our `sayhi` tool is installed into a `.dotnet\tools` folder in the user's directory:

![tools directory](/images/2018-03-cli.tools-dir.png)

The install command generates a `.exe` file as a warpper on windows and shell scripts on macOS / Linux. On windows, this is currently a .NET Framework executable, but it is planned to be replaced with a native executable for an upcoming preview.

## Bonus: Integrate with the `dotnet` command

The `dotnet` CLI always allowed to use programs named `dotnet-something` as verbs (=> `dotnet something`). This is now possible with global tools as well.

To do so, let's create a similar application `greet.tool` using the same steps as above, but in `greet.tool.csproj`, set `ToolCommandName` differently:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ToolCommandName>dotnet-greet</ToolCommandName>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

Now build and install this tool:

```
> dotnet pack
> dotnet install tool -g greet.tool
```

And it can be run using:

```
> dotnet greet
Hi martin.ullrich!
```

Note: This **currently does not work on macOS/Linux** (known bug) because the CLI does not search the `~/.dotnet/tools` path for verb executables.
